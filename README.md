# Input System Unity Rework

This is a example project creating a new way to improve the input system inside Unity. 

For that, I created a Input Manager that manage all inputs and send information to all subscribes components.

Inside the project, there are two scenes: A default HDR Unity project scene and a new HDR project called "Cave" that include HDR components and a different input controllers to probe this new input manager.
